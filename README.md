## How It Works
1. File Upload: The user uploads their resume in PDF format through the web interface.
2. PDF Parsing: The application extracts text from the uploaded PDF using a PDFminer library.
3. Resume Check: The application checks if the uploaded document is a valid resume using predefined keywords.
4. Roast Generation: If the document is a valid resume, the extracted text is sent to the Groq API, which generates a humorous roast.
5. Markdown Rendering: The roast response is converted from Markdown to HTML and displayed on the frontend.
